# DocFusionDB Development Roadmap

## Current State Analysis

DocFusionDB is a promising experimental document database that combines PostgreSQL's JSONB storage with Apache Arrow's DataFusion query engine. The current implementation has basic CLI functionality with 3 custom UDFs for JSON operations.

## Key Improvement Areas

### 1. **Core Infrastructure**
- Error handling and resilience
- Configuration management
- Connection pooling
- Comprehensive logging/metrics

### 2. **Data Management**
- Schema versioning
- Bulk operations
- Transactions
- Data validation

### 3. **Performance & Scalability**
- Query optimization
- Indexing strategies
- Caching layer
- Connection pooling

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- HTTP API server
- Web dashboard
- Better CLI with interactive mode
- SDK/client libraries

### 5. **Production Readiness**
- Authentication/authorization
- Comprehensive testing
- Monitoring/observability
- Backup/recovery

## Quick Win Priorities

1. **Error handling & configuration** - Critical for stability
2. **HTTP API server** - Essential for broader adoption
3. **Comprehensive testing** - Foundation for reliability
4. **Performance benchmarking** - Validate the core value proposition

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: Sub-100ms query latency for typical operations
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with proper error handling
- **Developer Experience**: Complete API documentation and examples
- **Production Readiness**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Community**: Active contributor base and ecosystem

## Implementation Notes

- Maintain backward compatibility throughout phases
- Focus on incremental improvements rather than rewrites
- Prioritize user feedback and real-world use cases
- Document all architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Establish clear testing and deployment procedures
