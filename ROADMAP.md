# DocFusionDB Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Philosophy: Lean & Essential

DocFusionDB is an **experimental** document database. We focus on core functionality that provides real value, avoiding over-engineering and premature optimization.

## ✅ Current State

DocFusionDB combines PostgreSQL's JSONB storage with DataFusion's query engine, providing:
- ✅ HTTP API server with bulk operations
- ✅ Custom JSON query functions (UDFs)  
- ✅ Production-ready error handling and logging
- ✅ Connection pooling and configuration management
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and CI pipeline

## 🚀 Development Phases

### **✅ Phase 1: Foundation** 
**Status**: COMPLETED

- ✅ Proper error types with retry logic
- ✅ YAML configuration with environment support  
- ✅ Connection pooling with health checks
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (13 tests passing)
- ✅ Structured JSON logging with performance metrics

### **✅ Phase 2: Core Features**
**Status**: COMPLETED (Lean Implementation)

- ✅ HTTP API server with RESTful endpoints
- ✅ Bulk operations (up to 1000 documents)
- ✅ Basic JSON validation
- ✅ GitHub CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Updated documentation

**Removed Bloat**: OpenAPI docs, rate limiting, complex schema validation, unnecessary middleware

### **🔄 Phase 3: Performance** 
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

**Goal**: Essential performance optimizations only

#### Essential Features:
- [ ] Query performance optimization
- [ ] Performance benchmarking tools
- [ ] Simple query result caching (if beneficial)
- [ ] Connection optimization

**Explicitly NOT doing**: Complex indexing strategies (PostgreSQL handles this), advanced caching architectures, over-engineered optimizations

### **⏳ Phase 4: Production Polish** 
**Status**: PLANNED

**Goal**: Minimal production-ready features

#### Essential Only:
- [ ] Basic authentication (API keys)
- [ ] Health monitoring endpoints
- [ ] Simple backup utilities
- [ ] Basic security hardening

**Explicitly NOT doing**: Complex auth systems, advanced monitoring, enterprise features

## 🎯 Success Metrics (Simple)

- **Performance**: Query latency improvements through benchmarking
- **Reliability**: Tests passing, error handling working
- **Usability**: Clear API, good documentation
- **Experimental Value**: Easy to test new ideas and features

## 📏 Principles

1. **Lean First**: Build only what's needed
2. **Measure Performance**: Benchmark before optimizing  
3. **Stay Experimental**: Fast iteration over enterprise features
4. **Quality Over Features**: Robust core over feature bloat

*This roadmap focuses on essential functionality. Complex enterprise features are intentionally excluded to keep DocFusionDB experimental and lightweight.*
