# Full Roadmap for DocFusionDB

## Overview
The roadmap is divided into four phases over 24 months, each building on the previous one to deliver a robust document database that combines Postgres’ JSONB storage with DataFusion’s query performance. The focus is on document storage initially, with extensions for analytics, AI, and distributed systems later, while fostering community growth and adoption.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 0-6)
**Goal**: Build a functional document storage engine with basic query optimization, establishing the core of DocFusionDB and gaining initial community traction.

### Milestones
#### M1.1: Research and Prototype JSONB Integration (Months 0-1)
- **Tasks**:
  - Study Postgres JSONB internals (e.g., storage format, GIN indexing).
  - Explore DataFusion’s TableProvider trait for integrating Postgres tables.
  - Create a prototype: Query a sample JSONB table via DataFusion.
- **Deliverables**:
  - A working prototype (Rust binary) that executes a simple SELECT on a JSONB column.
  - Documentation: Notes on JSONB + DataFusion integration challenges (in `/docs`).
- **Success Metric**: Prototype executes a query on 1K JSONB documents in <100ms.

#### M1.2: Implement Core Document Querying (Months 0-1)
- **Tasks**:
  - Extend `datafusion-postgres` to support JSONB as a native type.
  - Implement DataFusion operators for JSON path queries (e.g., `->`, `->>`).
  - Optimize GIN index scans with DataFusion for faster filtering.
  - Write unit tests for JSONB query correctness.
- **Deliverables**:
  - PR to `sunng87/datafusion-postgres` adding JSONB support.
  - Sample dataset: 10K JSONB documents (e.g., based on MongoDB’s `sample_airbnb`).
  - Basic CLI: Query JSONB tables with SQL (e.g., `SELECT doc->'field' FROM table`).
- **Success Metric**: Queries on 10K documents achieve <50ms latency.

#### M1.3: Release MVP (Months 1-2)
- **Tasks**:
  - Package the project as a Docker image (Postgres + DocFusionDB binary).
  - Support basic SQL operations: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE for JSONB.
  - Write setup docs and a demo app (e.g., a simple CMS backend).
  - Publish a blog post announcing the MVP.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Docker image on Docker Hub (`arrowpeak/docfusiondb:mvp`).
  - GitHub release: v0.1.0 with binaries and docs.
  - Blog post: “Introducing DocFusionDB: Documents Meet DataFusion.”
  - Demo: CMS app querying JSONB documents via DocFusionDB.
- **Success Metric**: 100 GitHub stars, 10 users trying the MVP (tracked via Slack feedback).

### Community Engagement
- Join Apache Arrow Slack and announce the project in #datafusion.
- Open 5 “good first issues” (e.g., “Add sample dataset,” “Improve CLI help text”).
- Share weekly updates on X (@DocFusionDB): “This week in DocFusionDB: JSONB prototype done! 🚀”

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: JSONB query performance lags.
  - **Mitigation**: Profile with `cargo flamegraph` and optimize DataFusion operators early.
- **Risk**: Low community interest.
  - **Mitigation**: Engage DataFusion-Postgres maintainers for feedback on PRs; offer mentorship for new contributors.

## Phase 2: Performance and Analytics (Months 6-12)
**Goal**: Enhance query speed, add analytics capabilities, and release a stable v1.0, solidifying DocFusionDB as a viable option for document-heavy workloads.

### Milestones
#### M2.1: Optimize Query Performance (Months 6-8)
- **Tasks**:
  - Vectorize JSONB operations in DataFusion (e.g., filtering, path extraction).
  - Implement caching for frequent JSONB queries.
  - Benchmark against vanilla Postgres and MongoDB using YCSB dataset.
  - Fix bugs reported from MVP feedback.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Performance report: DocFusionDB vs. Postgres vs. MongoDB (e.g., 2x faster on SELECT).
  - PR to `datafusion-postgres` for optimized JSONB operators.
  - GitHub release: v0.2.0 with performance improvements.
- **Success Metric**: 2x faster than Postgres for complex JSONB queries on 100K documents.

#### M2.2: Add Analytics Features (Months 8-10)
- **Tasks**:
  - Support aggregations (e.g., COUNT, SUM) on JSONB fields.
  - Enable joins between JSONB and relational tables.
  - Add support for external data formats (Parquet, Arrow) via DataFusion.
  - Write integration tests for hybrid queries (documents + analytics).
- **Deliverables**:
  - New SQL features: `SELECT COUNT(doc->'field') FROM table`.
  - Demo: Analytics dashboard querying JSONB + relational data.
  - PR to `datafusion-postgres` for Parquet/Arrow integration.
- **Success Metric**: Run a hybrid query (join + aggregation) on 1M documents in <200ms.

#### M2.3: Release v1.0 (Months 10-12)
- **Tasks**:
  - Stabilize the SQL API for production use.
  - Improve CLI: Add query profiling and error reporting.
  - Write tutorials: “Building a CMS with DocFusionDB.”
  - Submit a talk proposal for a conference (e.g., PGConf, RustConf).
- **Deliverables**:
  - GitHub release: v1.0.0 with stable API.
  - Tutorials published on `docfusiondb.com`.
  - CLI tool: `docfusiondb --profile` for query stats.
  - Conference talk proposal submitted.
- **Success Metric**: 500 GitHub stars, 50 companies/projects using v1.0 (tracked via Docker pulls).

### Community Engagement

- Open 10 new issues for analytics features (e.g., “Add GROUP BY support”).
- Share benchmarks on X: “DocFusionDB v1.0: 2x faster than Postgres for JSONB! 📊”

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Analytics features introduce complexity.
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on a small, well-tested set of features (e.g., COUNT, joins).
- **Risk**: Bugs in v1.0 deter users.
  - **Mitigation**: Add extensive integration tests; release v0.9.x betas for community testing.
