# DocFusionDB Tweets

## 🚀 Launch Tweet

I just built something I've been wanting for ages - a document database that's actually simple to understand and deploy! 

DocFusionDB combines PostgreSQL's rock-solid JSONB storage with DataFusion's blazing query engine. No enterprise bloat, no vendor lock-in, just the good stuff.

⚡ Smart caching, bulk ops, API auth, backup/restore
🦀 Built in Rust because why not make it fast AND safe
📊 Monitoring endpoints because production matters

Perfect for side projects that might actually grow into something real.

## 🎯 Technical Thread

🧵 1/4 Real talk: I got tired of choosing between MongoDB (too much magic) and rolling my own JSON storage (too much work).

So I built DocFusionDB - PostgreSQL for durability + DataFusion for speed. Best of both worlds without the enterprise complexity.

🧵 2/4 Here's what actually matters for most projects:

⚡ Query caching that just works (no Redis needed)
📦 Bulk operations because loading data shouldn't suck  
🔐 Simple API auth (just set an env var)
💾 Backup/restore that outputs readable JSON

The boring stuff that saves you hours.

🧵 3/4 My favorite part? The philosophy.

I actually REMOVED features during development:
- No OpenAPI docs (just read the code)
- No complex auth (99% of projects need API keys max)
- No rate limiting (your reverse proxy handles this)

Less code = fewer bugs = happier developers.

🧵 4/4 Want to try it? Literally 3 commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arrowpeak/docfusiondb
cargo run -- serve
curl -X POST localhost:8080/documents -d '{"document": {"name": "test"}}'
```

That's it. No Docker, no config files, no PhD in database administration required.

## 🔥 Performance Tweet

Okay this is pretty cool - DocFusionDB now has a `/metrics` endpoint that shows you exactly what's happening:

📊 Cache hit rates (because caching that doesn't work is just wasted RAM)
⏱️ Uptime tracking (your database shouldn't be a mystery box)
💾 Document counts and connection pools
🖥️ System info because why not

The best part? It's all just JSON, no fancy dashboards needed. `curl /metrics | jq` and you're done.

Sometimes the simple solution is the right solution.

## 🤔 Philosophy Tweet

Hot take: Most databases are optimized for resumes, not real problems.

"We support 47 different auth methods!" 
Cool, I just need API keys.

"Advanced query optimization!" 
Great, caching fixed 90% of my performance issues.

"Enterprise-grade monitoring!"
Perfect, `curl /metrics` tells me everything I need to know.

DocFusionDB: built for actual humans who want to ship stuff. 🚢

## 👥 Community Tweet

PSA: DocFusionDB is open source and I'm genuinely curious what you'd build with it.

It's perfect for that side project where you need to store JSON but don't want to deal with MongoDB's quirks or DynamoDB's pricing surprises.

Also great for:
🧑‍💻 Learning Rust (the code is pretty readable)
📊 Database experiments (it's literally called experimental)
⚡ Performance testing (built-in metrics!)

What would you store in a lean document database?

## 🏗️ Architecture Tweet

The DocFusionDB stack is beautifully boring:

🌐 Axum for HTTP (because it's fast and I understand it)
⚡ DataFusion for queries (Apache knows how to build query engines)  
🗄️ PostgreSQL for storage (20+ years of battle testing)

Each piece does ONE thing well. No magic glue, no proprietary formats, no lock-in.

If you don't like my HTTP layer? Swap it. Don't like DataFusion? Use something else.

That's what "composable software" actually means.

## 📊 Stats Tweet

Some numbers that make me happy:

📦 29 total dependencies (including transitive)
🧪 Tests actually pass (shocking, I know)
⚡ 5-minute query cache because that's usually enough
📝 Backup/restore outputs readable JSON
🎯 4 development phases done, kept removing features
🦀 Written in Rust because memory safety is nice

The best metric? I can explain every line of code to you in an afternoon.

## 🚀 Call to Action Tweet

You know what? Just try it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arrowpeak/docfusiondb
cargo run -- serve
curl -X POST localhost:8080/documents -d '{"document": {"test": true}}'
```

Three commands. No Docker, no YAML files, no complicated setup.

If you need to store JSON and want something that just works without the enterprise complexity, this might be for you.

Or maybe it's terrible and you'll tell me why. Either way, I'd love to know.
